I always felt a deep thirst, dissatisfaction with the status quo, and a sense of loneliness. There are many places where this could stem from. I started primary school at the age of four, and having no peers wanted to play with. I constantly moved to new, bigger cities for school as an `outsider`. Or maybe I have an organic condition, like trigeminal neuralgia, and the cause was traced through medical tests. I am lonely, accustomed to talking to myself. I’ve written down all these words, imagining various scenes and characters speaking them. In the end, it became my `dream`—to convey my thoughts and influence the world through these words. Thankfully, this dream has kept me from being consumed by loneliness, from becoming one of the casualties of autism. But it also makes me constantly overly ambitious. I've never been at peace; every moment is consumed by this dream. It’s like the sun of my world—I can shield my eyes, but it’s futile.

At ECNU, studying Software Engineering was less about learning knowledge and more about learning how to struggle with myself.I feel like I have significant mental struggles, like constantly worrying about things like car accidents or the possibility of a world war, which often leaves me feeling paralyzed and unwilling to do anything. On top of that, my family's business failure made everything feel like a gloomy, bleak world? But thankfully, I have my dream, and my dark humor style. Even when I'm at my lowest point, I can always bounce back and get things done, preventing myself from spiraling into despair. I owe a lot to my ambition for keeping me going.

I went to Tokyo for work and managed to survive the immense pressure of the job and the COVID backdrop, eventually returning to China. There's so much to the story, and it could be overwhelming at times. But it seemed to have a paradoxical effect on me—rather than making me more depressed like during my college years, it actually improved my mindset significantly. Now, even if tomorrow marks the start of World War III, I wouldn't care much. The downside, however, was that during that time, I grew to really dislike being a programmer.

After returning to China, I considered transitioning into finance and tried various paths, even earning a securities qualification. But in the end, I realized that, deep down, I truly love programming. In the small world of code, I have control over every component—from its name to its life cycle—and there's an immense sense of achievement in making that world run flawlessly. So, I returned to Shanghai and joined Citi Group. It turns out that what I truly disliked was not the profession of programming, but the work culture in Japan. Now, my life feels relatively comfortable. Perhaps I could buy a house, settle down, marry, and have children—some might call that a small success. Yet, unfortunately, restlessness runs deep within me. There’s an insatiable drive to push forward, to honor the "dream" that has saved me in countless ways. I don’t know exactly how to achieve it. It’s like applying to a university—you can never know your chances for sure. But what I do know is that if I don’t apply, if I don’t take that first step, the chances are zero.
I feel this pull, this need to venture into a larger world, to experience more, and to find a place where I can speak these stories freely. And so, this is my plan—the plan before all other plans. I want to pursue graduate studies, to step beyond the borders of China, and if fate allows, to rise even higher.

`Like a hyena chaseing the meat in the lion's mouth, If I stop, I might end up devouring myself`
